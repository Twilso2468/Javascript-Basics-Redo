			<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
			<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented
				 scripting language. JavasScript is extremely
				 popular for a variety of reasons.
				 It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility
				 for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
				 Javascript lives inside a host enviroment
				 (a web browser or Node Server),
				 it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provide
				 programmatic control over them.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="placeholder">Variable Declaration</a>- JavaScript variables
					 are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with
					  coffee, the cup holds the coffee a variable holds a value.
					  All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
					  These unique names are called identifiers.</li>
				<li><a href="placeholder">Variable Assignment</a>- Assignment operators assign
					values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
					giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a
					value to a variable. var x = 10; </li>
				<li><a href="placeholder">Data Types</a>- Data Types are an important concept;
					to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.
					There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives:
					Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing;
					Number - 42 or 3.14159;
					String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!";
					Array - [1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];
					and Object - {first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'} </li>
				<li><a href="placeholder">Conditionals</a>When you write code, you want to perform
					different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based
					on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements
					in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:
					if a specified is true, do this code in our code block;
					else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
					else we execute this block of</li>
				<li><a href="placeholder">Loops</a>There are many different kinds of loops in
					every programming languages, buy they all essentially do the same thing:
					they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile,
					well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
				<li><a href="placeholder">Function</a>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.
					When we call our function this will run that code block.
					Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk
					from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top;
					next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly
					there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
